    <h1>Learn About Disney</h1>
    <main>
    <h2>Hotels</h2>
        <p>When going to Disney World, it is important to find the best deal of hotels. Staying at Disney hotels is beneficial because they provide transportation for free to and from the parks. They also have a dining area for the guests so that they do not have to leave to go find meals. When looking at the different prices for hotels, it is important to look for the best time of the year to visit. You can pull up a website on Disneyâ€™s booking website to see when the cheapest prices are to stay in each hotel and that fit your budget!</p>
        <p>A list of the most affordable Disney resorts are The All-Star Resorts, Pop Century, and the Campgrounds. Another cheaper option would be to stay at a nearby hotel. Although this will take away the free transportation provided through Disney when you stay on Disney grounds.</p>
    <h2>Tickets</h2>
        <p>Next is finding the best ticket prices! Disney tickets can be very pricey, and it can be difficult to find cheaper prices. The first way to discounted tickets is to visit the parks during the week. Tickets during the week are cheaper than if you are visiting the parks on the weekend. Also, look at local stores to see if they have discounted tickets. Tickets also have a calendar to look at to see what time of the year tickets are the cheapest and we can see that hotels correspond with these prices! Local stores also sell discounted tickets if you purchase at their store!</p>
    <h2>Dining Plan</h2>
    <p>We can find out how to save money with food and dining. When you stay on Disney property, they offer you a dining service plan. This where each person in your party can receive 3 meals and 3 snack credits a day that you can use in your hotel or in the parks. There are different levels to each dining plan and can upgrade to where it covers sit down restaurants in the parks. This can help control overspending on meals while at the parks since food can be expensive! You also can download the Disney Parks app to make reservations in advance so that you are guaranteed a spot when you visit! 
        <p>Disney Dining Plan: Everyone in the party ages 3 and over will receive the following each night of their package stay:  one Table-Service Meal, one Quick-Service Meal, and two snacks. You can redeem your meals and snacks in any order during your stay until the number of meals and snacks associated with your package have been all used. A refillable drink mug eligible for refills at disney hotels but not in the parks.  All unused meals and snacks and the ability to use your refillable mug expire at midnight on your package reservation checkout date.</p>
