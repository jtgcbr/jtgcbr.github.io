    <main><p> Hello! My name is Jessica Gebauer and I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I graduated from Winnetonka High School and then headed off to community college. I finished my Associates in Arts at Metropolitan Community College. At this time, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but once I started at <em>University of Missouri</em>, they helped me figure out what I was passionate about. I am currently studying <em>education</em> with an emphasis in psychology. I plan on finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree in fall of 2021. I hope to become an elementary psychologist and help children navigate feelings that they might not understand. In my free time, I love doing everything Disney! I grew up watching Disney Princesses and never grew out of it! I love what Disney represents and love sharing my passion and knowledge to everyone else!</p><br/>
