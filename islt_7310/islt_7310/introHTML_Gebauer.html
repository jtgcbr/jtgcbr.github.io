     Hello, my name is Jessica Gebauer. I am from Kansas City, MO. I attend the University of Missouri. I am studying education with an emphasis on psychology. I want to become an Elementary Psychologist. I find it important to help children learn at an early age how to cope with traumas or any issue they have. It can be hard to understand such big emotions in a tiny body. I do not have any previous web application or development training. I hope to just have fun with this course and learn something new. I want to take these skills I learn into my future career and possibly have a better understanding on how websites and technology work. In my free time I love to explore new things and be outdoors. I hope once I graduate that I can travel to new places.
